Zombie Manager

 

We need to keep track of our captured zombies and we'd like a web app set up to do so.

There are three quarantine zones: a school, a hospital and a warehouse, and zombies may be blockaded in any of these locations. We need to add a new zombie. We need to move all the zombies from one place to another. And, of course, it would be helpful to see where all our zombies are.

Please include a fully-functional API and a front end to interact with the API, then submit your code in a Github repo we can access.
